Section 4 - Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b.

Your use of the Licensed Material:

reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database for NonCommercial purposes only; b. if You include all or a substantial
portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis

reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the
